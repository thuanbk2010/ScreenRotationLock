This is the source code of YuhApps' Screen Rotation Lock for Android, which can be downloaded from Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yuh.yuh.rotationlock.

Feel free to fork the project. However, I would appreciate some credit if you take my code and build into your own project.
